/// `colamd`: an approximate minimum degree column ordering algorithm,
/// for LU factorization of symmetric or unsymmetric matrices,

/// linear programming problems, and other related problems.
///
/// `symamd`: an approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm for Cholesky
/// factorization of symmetric matrices.
///
/// Colamd computes a permutation `Q` such that the Cholesky factorization of
/// `(AQ)'(AQ)` has less fill-in and requires fewer floating point operations
/// than `A'A`. This also provides a good ordering for sparse partial
/// pivoting methods, `P(AQ) = LU`, where `Q` is computed prior to numerical
/// factorization, and `P` is computed during numerical factorization via
/// conventional partial pivoting with row interchanges. Colamd is the
/// column ordering method used in SuperLU, part of the ScaLAPACK library.
/// It is also available as built-in function in MATLAB Version 6,
/// available from MathWorks, Inc. (http://www.mathworks.com). This
/// routine can be used in place of colmmd in MATLAB.
///
/// Symamd computes a permutation `P` of a symmetric matrix A such that the
/// Cholesky factorization of `PAP'` has less fill-in and requires fewer
/// floating point operations than `A`. Symamd constructs a matrix `M` such
/// that `M'M` has the same nonzero pattern of `A`, and then orders the columns
/// of `M` using colmmd. The column ordering of `M` is then returned as the
/// row and column ordering `P` of `A`.

/// developed in collaboration with John Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and Esmond
/// Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
